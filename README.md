Here I am rebuilding this page from the NY Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0
I decided to use grid for the main layout. The original site uses grid only for the article suggestions at the bottom. It is a bit tricky to lay out the images like in the example, because they are differently sized. I thought about using a wider grid with 12 columns, but I decided against it, because for this use case, it would provide sparsely any additional value. In general, this example is a pretty good example for the value of using grid (e.g. using grid gap, I spare myself a lot of playing around with margins).
