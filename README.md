Here I am rebuilding this page from the NY Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0
I decided to use grid for the main layout. The original site uses grid only for the article suggestions at the bottom. It is a bit tricky to lay out the images like in the example, because they are differently sized. I thought about using a wider grid with 12 columns, but I decided against it, because for this use case, it would provide sparsely any additional value. In general, this example is a pretty good example for the value of using grid (e.g. using grid gap, I spare myself a lot of playing around with margins).
I styled the top-bar using flex. This works quite fine, and usually it would be best to just put justify-content: space-between or something like that on it and let it be. However, I decided to make the spacing as similar as possible to the original site and to achieve this, I had to work a lot with margins on the single objects. This works well enough in full screen mode, but the responsive behavior becomes kinda weird and not like the one of the original site. It seems they did it with nesting multiple elements.
